# REPOSTLY

**Bot that finds trending vids from your favorite subreddits and posts them on your TikTok by itself.**\
This is the very first Prototype and is still in progress.

install requirements  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Update the `config.py` for your account and genre.


  
Run the app  
```
python main.py //windows
python3 main.py //Linux
```





NOTE: the app is outdated as it works with a headless browser for TikTok upload, and tiktok updated their site. Can get it running by changing `XPath`s for selenium in the `Tiktok/` module.
